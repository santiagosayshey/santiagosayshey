### [Hey!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVCUAXOBF7w) 👋

I'm Sam (or santiagosayshey as many people online know me as). I'm a final year computer science student at the University of Adelaide with a passion for all things self hosting! 🌐

#### Here are some of my projects: 
- [Dictionarry](https://dictionarry.pages.dev/) 📚 - A wiki dedicated to abstracting the complexity of media automation. Come say Hey in our [discord!](https://discord.com/invite/Y9TYP6jeYZ) 💬
- [Profilarr](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/Profilarr) 🛠️ - Some complimentary *arr scripts that helps to improve import / export / sync / delete functionality. Built in conjunction with Dictionarry.
- [Rogue](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/Rogue) ⚔️ - A first year Object Oriented Programming project inspired by the most influential game of all time - [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game))
- [ClubHub](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/ClubHub) 🎉 - A second year Web & Database Computing project to build a full stack Uni Club app. 
- [DigiBrain](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/DigiBrain) 🧠 - A backup of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault containing all of my uni notes. 
- [whoami](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/whoami-frontend) 🙋‍♂️ - A WIP online journaling / gratitude app I built to help with my mental health. 

#### Here are some projects that I want to work on someday!
- A polymorphic tracker framework  capable of processing all media types through NoSQL.
- A survival / Roguelite / base-builder with impactful decisions, a branching narrative, and complex characters!
