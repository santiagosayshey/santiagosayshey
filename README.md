### [Hey!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVCUAXOBF7w) 👋

I'm Sam (or santiagosayshey as many people online know me as). I'm a final year computer science student at the University of Adelaide with a passion for all things self hosting! 🌐

#### Here are some of my projects: 
- [Dictionarry](https://dictionarry.pages.dev/) 📚 - A wiki dedicated to abstracting the complexity of media automation with an emphasis on tailored quality profiles and custom formats. Come say Hey in our [discord!](https://discord.com/invite/Y9TYP6jeYZ) 💬
- [Profilarr](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/Profilarr) 🛠️ - An open source complimentary *arr tool that helps to improve import / export / sync functionality. Built in conjunction with Dictionarry.
- [Rogue](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/Rogue) ⚔️ - A first year Object Oriented Programming project inspired by the most influential game of all time - [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)). I'm quite proud of this one - the use of polymorphism to design states is the most fun and elegant programming I've ever done.
- [ClubHub](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/ClubHub) 🎉 - A second year Web & Database Computing project to build a full stack Uni Club app. This project was pretty fun too, we used ChatGPT to write some hilarious concept clubs and Midjourney to draw the illustrations.
- [DigiBrain](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/DigiBrain) 🧠 - A backup of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that I use to open source and share my Uni notes.
- [whoami](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/whoami-frontend) 🙋‍♂️ - A WIP online journaling / gratitude app I built to help with my mental health. 

#### Here are some projects that I want to work on someday!
- A fully polymorphic future proofed tracker framework built on NoSQL 💾.
- A Survival / Roguelite / Base-builder inspired by The Walking Dead & Dave the Diver with impactful decisions, a branching narrative, and complex characters! 🧟‍♂️🏰
- A compliment(arr)y tool for Radarr / Sonarr to make upgrades / downgrades less painful 🎯.

#### Here are some fun facts about me:
- I (la la) love the Pixies 🎶. I have every studio album in every available format (Vinyl, CD, SACD, Cassette), as well as their live albums, EPs, singles, and (almost) all their bootlegs. [Here's me](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl6DFJ2onbs/?hl=en) at the bottom right front row of the Thebby at their Adelaide show in 2022! 🤘
- My online username is inspired by the Pixies! Joey **Santiago** is their lead guitarist and a personal hero of mine. **Hey** is my favourite song by them. Hence, Santiago .. says ... Hey! 🎸
- My programming rabbit hole started in my final year of high school when I discovered open directories after trying to find Game of Thrones episodes online. That led to me discovering Plex, trackers, automation, and finally, programming. It's a bit of a backwards journey, but I'm glad it happened this way 👨‍💻.
- I'm a vocal advocate for all things mental health 🧠💚. I often talk (and write) about my journey to help others.
- I host a local Plex Server for friends and family and use 0 streaming services. Not even Spotify! 🎥🏠
- I have over 1700 hours in Factorio. It's like programming - but killing bugs with artillery is much more fun :P💥
